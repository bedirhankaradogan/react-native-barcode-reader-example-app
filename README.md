# react-native-barcode-reader-example-app

I've just created an example project with React Native which could be used for barcode reading. I've used `onBarCodeRead` feature of the [react-native-camera](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-camera). You can visit document page to learn more about `onBarCodeRead` feature from [here](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-camera/blob/master/docs/RNCamera.md#bar-code-related-props).

### Installation

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run `npm install` command in the root directory.
3. Lastly run `react-native run-android` for Android, `react-native run-ios` for IOS.

### Demo

#### Notes

1. I haven't tested it in IOS yet.
2. Because of I haven't tested it in IOS, I can't be sure about react-native-camera installation for IOS. So you might be need to make additional settings for IOS.
